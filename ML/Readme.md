This module implements a machine learning based recommendation system
for suggesting Focus or Normal mode in the Adaptive OS project.

The ML model does NOT enforce mode switching.
It only provides suggestions based on user activity patterns.

Exam mode bypasses ML completely and remains deterministic.
